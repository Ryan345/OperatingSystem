Operating System project for class, Spring 2016

Use ./compileOS.sh to compile the kernel.  If file is not executable run 'chmod +x compileOS.sh'
Use ./loadFile fib to load the fib program into the OS.
Run the OS with 'bochs -f osxterm.txt', if bochs hangs terminate the command and run it again, sometimes it takes multiple times for the OS to boot.
