Simple Shell

A compile version is already provided, however, if you need to compile it.  Type ./compile.sh.  If that file is not already executable type chmod +x compile.sh.  Then run ./compile.sh.
After you compile the shell it will create a file called myshell that you can execute.  Type ./myshell and the shell will load.
You can type help to view a list of the commands, how to use them and what they do.
To leave the shell either hit Ctrl+C or type Q.

If you have a problem with the S command, to launch firefox.  It may show some output, but you are still able to type after the output.  Just hit enter.
